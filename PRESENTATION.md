## Slide 4: Technology Stack

*   **Framework:** Next.js (v15.2.3)
    *   App Router for efficient routing and layouts.
    *   Server Components & Client Components for optimized rendering.
*   **Language:** TypeScript
    *   Ensures type safety and improved code quality.
*   **Styling:**
    *   Tailwind CSS: Utility-first CSS framework.
    *   ShadCN UI: Collection of accessible and customizable UI components.
    *   CSS Variables: For robust theming (light/dark modes).
*   **UI Components & Icons:**
    *   Radix UI (Primitives for ShadCN UI).
    *   Lucide React: For clean and consistent icons.
*   **State Management:**
    *   React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useCallback`).
*   **Data Fetching:**
    *   Native `fetch` API.
*   **Weather Data API:** WeatherAPI.com
    *   Provides weather data and city suggestions.
    *   Requires an API key (managed via environment variables).
*   **Development & Build Tools:**
    *   Next.js CLI (`next dev`, `next build`).
    *   npm for package management.
*   **Fonts:** Geist Sans & Geist Mono.

## Slide 5: Project Structure (Brief)

*   `src/app/`: Main application pages (`page.tsx`), root layout (`layout.tsx`), global styles (`globals.css`).
*   `src/components/`:
    *   `ui/`: ShadCN UI components.
    *   `weather/`: Custom weather-specific components (`city-search-form.tsx`, `weather-display.tsx`, `weather-icon.tsx`).
    *   `theme-provider.tsx`, `theme-toggle.tsx`.
*   `src/hooks/`: Custom React hooks (e.g., `useToast`).
*   `src/lib/`: Utility functions (`utils.ts`), API interaction logic (`weather-api.ts`).
*   `src/types/`: TypeScript type definitions (`weather.ts`).
*   `public/`: Static assets (currently minimal).
*   Configuration files: `next.config.ts`, `tailwind.config.ts`, `tsconfig.json`, `package.json`.

## Slide 6: How It Works (High-Level Flow)

1.  **Load:** Application initializes, `HomePage` renders. API key check occurs.
2.  **Search:** User types in `CitySearchForm`.
    *   Suggestions fetched via `fetchCitySuggestions` (debounced).
    *   User selects a city.
3.  **Fetch Weather:** `handleCitySelect` in `HomePage` calls `fetchWeatherData` with selected city's coordinates.
4.  **Display:**
    *   `WeatherDisplay` component receives and renders the `WeatherData`.
    *   `WeatherIcon` shows appropriate icon.
5.  **States:** Loading spinners, error messages, or initial prompt are shown based on application state.
6.  **Theming:** `ThemeProvider` and `ThemeToggle` manage light/dark/system themes.

## Slide 7: Application Demo (Placeholder)

*(This is where you would typically show a live demo or screenshots of the application)*

*   **Screenshot 1:** Main page, initial state.
    *   *Description: User is prompted to search for a city.*
*   **Screenshot 2:** City search with suggestions.
    *   *Description: User types "London", suggestions appear.*
*   **Screenshot 3:** Weather display for a selected city (Light Theme).
    *   *Description: Shows current weather, temperature, details, and sunrise/sunset for London.*
*   **Screenshot 4:** Weather display (Dark Theme).
    *   *Description: Same data, but in dark mode.*
*   **Screenshot 5:** Error state (e.g., API key missing or network error).
    *   *Description: Shows how the application handles errors gracefully.*
*   **Screenshot 6:** Responsive view (Mobile).
    *   *Description: How the application looks on a smaller screen.*

## Slide 8: Challenges & Solutions

*   **Challenge:** Handling asynchronous API calls efficiently and providing good user feedback.
    *   **Solution:** Implemented debouncing for city suggestions, clear loading states, and toast notifications for errors.
*   **Challenge:** Ensuring a clean and maintainable codebase.
    *   **Solution:** Used TypeScript, structured project into reusable components, and followed Next.js best practices.
*   **Challenge:** Managing API keys securely.
    *   **Solution:** Utilized environment variables (`.env.local`) for API key storage, excluded from version control.
*   **Challenge:** Creating a dynamic and accurate weather icon system.
    *   **Solution:** Mapped WeatherAPI condition codes to a comprehensive set of Lucide icons, considering day/night variations.

## Slide 9: Potential Future Enhancements

*   **Extended Forecast:** Display 5-day or 7-day weather forecasts.
*   **Interactive Maps:** Integrate a map view to select locations or visualize weather patterns.
*   **User Accounts:** Allow users to save favorite locations.
*   **Geolocation:** Option to automatically fetch weather for the user's current location.
*   **Air Quality Index (AQI):** Integrate AQI data.
*   **Weather Alerts:** Display active weather alerts for the selected region.
*   **Unit Conversion:** Allow users to switch between Celsius/Fahrenheit, kph/mph.
*   **Internationalization (i18n):** Support multiple languages.
*   **GenAI Feature:** Implement a "weather summary" or "packing suggestions" feature using Genkit.
