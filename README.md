# WeatherWise - Real-Time Weather Application

WeatherWise is a modern web application built with Next.js that allows users to search for cities and view real-time weather information. It provides current weather conditions, temperature, humidity, wind speed, sunrise/sunset times, and other relevant details in an intuitive and visually appealing interface.

## Project Structure

The project follows a standard Next.js App Router structure:

*   `src/app/`: Core application pages, layouts, and global styles.
*   `src/components/`: Reusable UI components, including ShadCN UI and custom weather components.
*   `src/hooks/`: Custom React hooks (e.g., `useToast`, `useMobile`).
*   `src/lib/`: Utility functions and API interaction logic (e.g., `weather-api.ts`).
*   `src/types/`: TypeScript type definitions.
*   `public/`: Static assets (if any).
*   `.env.local.example`: Example for environment variable setup.
*   `out/`: This directory will be generated after running `npm run build` and will contain the static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for deployment.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (v18 or later recommended)
*   npm (comes with Node.js)
*   A WeatherAPI.com API Key

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url> # Replace <repository-url> with the actual URL
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    *   You need an API key from [WeatherAPI.com](https://www.weatherapi.com/).
    *   Create a file named `.env.local` in the root of your project by copying the example:
        ```bash
        cp .env.local.example .env.local
        ```
    *   Open `.env.local` and add your WeatherAPI.com API key:
        ```
        NEXT_PUBLIC_WEATHERAPI_COM_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
        ```
        Replace `"YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"` with your actual key.

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will typically start the application on `http://localhost:9002` (as per your `package.json`).

2.  Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:9002`.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

*   `npm run dev`: Runs the app in development mode with Turbopack.
*   `npm run build`: Builds the app for production. This will generate a static export in the `out/` directory.
*   `npm run start`: Starts a production server (after building, not applicable for static export).
*   `npm run lint`: Lints the codebase using Next.js's built-in ESLint configuration.
*   `npm run typecheck`: Runs TypeScript type checking.
*   `npm run genkit:dev`: Starts the Genkit development server (if Genkit flows are used).
*   `npm run genkit:watch`: Starts the Genkit development server with watch mode.

## API Used

This application uses the [WeatherAPI.com](https://www.weatherapi.com/) service to fetch weather data and city suggestions. You must obtain a free API key from their website and configure it in the `.env.local` file as `NEXT_PUBLIC_WEATHERAPI_COM_API_KEY`.

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

This Next.js application has been configured for static export, making it suitable for deployment on GitHub Pages.

1.  **Build the Project:**
    Run the build command:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    This will generate a static version of your application in the `out` directory. This directory will contain the `index.html` file and other necessary static assets (CSS, JS).

2.  **Push to GitHub:**
    Commit and push the `out` directory (or its contents) to your GitHub repository. Make sure your repository is public if you're using a free GitHub account for GitHub Pages.
    *Note: It's common to have a separate branch (e.g., `gh-pages`) for the contents of the `out` directory, or to use GitHub Actions to automate the build and deployment process.*

3.  **Configure GitHub Pages:**
    *   Go to your repository settings on GitHub.
    *   Navigate to the "Pages" section.
    *   Under "Build and deployment", select "Deploy from a branch" as the source.
    *   Choose the branch you want to deploy from (e.g., `main` or `gh-pages`).
    *   Select the folder containing your static files (usually `/out` or `/docs` if you move the contents of `out` to a `docs` folder in the root of your deployment branch).
    *   Save the changes. GitHub will build and deploy your site.

4.  **(Optional) Configure `basePath` for Project Sites:**
    If your GitHub Pages site is a project site (e.g., `https://<username>.github.io/<repository-name>/`), you will need to configure the `basePath` in your `next.config.ts` file.
    For example, if your repository is named `my-weather-app`, you would add:
    ```javascript
    // next.config.ts
    const nextConfig = {
      output: 'export',
      basePath: '/my-weather-app', // Set this to your repository name
      // ... other configurations
    };
    ```
    After adding `basePath`, you'll need to rebuild (`npm run build`) and redeploy. Links and asset paths will then be prefixed correctly.

5.  **Access Your Site:**
    Your site should be available at `https://<username>.github.io/<repository-name>/` (if `basePath` is set for a project site) or `https://<username>.github.io/` (if it's a user/organization site and deployed from the root of the `main` branch, for example).
