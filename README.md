# WeatherWise - Real-Time Weather Application

WeatherWise is a modern web application built with Next.js that allows users to search for cities and view real-time weather information. It provides current weather conditions, temperature, humidity, wind speed, sunrise/sunset times, and other relevant details in an intuitive and visually appealing interface.

*   **Astronomical Data:** See sunrise and sunset times for the selected city.
*   **Daily Forecast:** Min/max temperature for the day.
*   **Responsive Design:** Adapts to various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
*   **Theming:** Light, Dark, and System theme options.
*   **Error Handling:** Graceful error messages for API key issues or data fetching failures.
*   **Loading States:** Clear loading indicators during data fetching.
*   **Toast Notifications:** Non-intrusive feedback for important events (e.g., errors).
*   **Optimized Icons:** Uses Lucide React icons for a clean and consistent look.

## Project Structure

The project follows a standard Next.js App Router structure:

*   `src/app/`: Core application pages, layouts, and global styles.
*   `src/components/`: Reusable UI components, including ShadCN UI and custom weather components.
*   `src/hooks/`: Custom React hooks (e.g., `useToast`, `useMobile`).
*   `src/lib/`: Utility functions and API interaction logic (e.g., `weather-api.ts`).
*   `src/types/`: TypeScript type definitions.
*   `public/`: Static assets (if any).
*   `.env.local.example`: Example for environment variable setup.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (v18 or later recommended)
*   npm (comes with Node.js)
*   A WeatherAPI.com API Key

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url> # Replace <repository-url> with the actual URL
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    *   You need an API key from [WeatherAPI.com](https://www.weatherapi.com/).
    *   Create a file named `.env.local` in the root of your project by copying the example:
        ```bash
        cp .env.local.example .env.local
        ```
    *   Open `.env.local` and add your WeatherAPI.com API key:
        ```
        NEXT_PUBLIC_WEATHERAPI_COM_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
        ```
        Replace `"YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"` with your actual key.

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will typically start the application on `http://localhost:9002` (as per your `package.json`).

2.  Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:9002`.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

*   `npm run dev`: Runs the app in development mode with Turbopack.
*   `npm run build`: Builds the app for production.
*   `npm run start`: Starts a production server (after building).
*   `npm run lint`: Lints the codebase using Next.js's built-in ESLint configuration.
*   `npm run typecheck`: Runs TypeScript type checking.
*   `npm run genkit:dev`: Starts the Genkit development server (if Genkit flows are used).
*   `npm run genkit:watch`: Starts the Genkit development server with watch mode.

## API Used

This application uses the [WeatherAPI.com](https://www.weatherapi.com/) service to fetch weather data and city suggestions. You must obtain a free API key from their website and configure it in the `.env.local` file as `NEXT_PUBLIC_WEATHERAPI_COM_API_KEY`.
